### Description

As I move closer to acquiring XP and also moving towards .Net, I came across these two pages on MSDN. One page is a free, softcopy book converting VB6 to .Net &amp; the other actually pertains to VB6 and Vista. I found them worthwhile, and you might too.

1. Will Vista support VB6? Per the 1st link listed below: Yes. At least for another 10 years; now that is promissing. But there will be changes & probably some bugs. Some things that you may use in various projects won't be provided with Vista. Not included with Vista are the common controls OCX. This means you may need to provide them with your projects when running on a Vista platform. Here's the link:

=================================================
2. VB6 to .Net conversion. Microsoft is providing a free 21 chapter softcopy of a book titled: "Upgrading to .Net". This may be old news to some, but I wasn't aware of it. So if you plan on moving towards .Net in the near future, get the freebie while it lasts. Here is that link: http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbrun/staythepath/AdditionalResources/UpgradingVB6/default.aspx
3. VB9.0 the future of VB?
